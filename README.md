Algorithms that are able to recognize objects in two dimensional images can create ethical dilemmas.  In 2018 researchers published an article about how they were able to train an algorithm to recognizes the faces of people and determines details about them like their age, gender, and ethnicity (Van Noorden, 2020).  A Chinese company, Huawei, tweaked the algorithm to specifically detect the faces of Uyghur people and tested it using street cameras (Harwell & Dou, 2020).  The Uyghur people live in Xinjiang, a northwestern portion of China.  China has been in the process of detaining the Uyghurs.  Their official reason for their detainment was to combat terrorism, but critics suggest that China is attempting to suppress any cultural identity that doesnâ€™t involve loyalty to the Communist Party (Chavkin et al., 2019).  Huawei is accused of using the algorithm to help China crack down on the Uyghur population (Van Noorden, 2020).  While the original intention of the research was not nefarious at all, it illustrates how their advances can be used to for unethical purposes.
